Bike Sales Analysis â€“ Excel Project

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analysis workflow using Microsoft Excel, starting from raw unorganized data and progressing through data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. The goal is to analyze customer behavior and identify patterns in bike purchases.

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

The raw dataset contained customer details such as age, gender, marital status, region, income, and purchase history. To make the dataset analysis-ready, several data cleaning steps were performed:

Removed duplicates and irrelevant entries.

Standardized categorical data (e.g., converting M/F to Male/Female, S/M to Single/Married).

Cleaned Income values by removing decimals and currency symbols.

Created Age Brackets (Young: 20â€“30, Middle Age: 31â€“59, Old: 60+).

Handled missing or invalid values for consistency.

ðŸ”¹ Data Transformation

To enhance insights, new calculated fields were created:

Chance to Buy Score â€“ based on Age, Income, and Marital Status.

Bike Interest Flag â€“ indicating potential interest in purchasing.

Grouped Income levels and Regions for segmentation.

ðŸ”¹ Analysis & Dashboard

Using Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts, customer trends were explored across multiple dimensions:

Gender vs Bike Purchases

Age Brackets vs Purchases

Income vs Purchases

Region-wise comparisons

An interactive Excel Dashboard was then built with slicers and charts to provide a clear, dynamic view of customer behavior.
